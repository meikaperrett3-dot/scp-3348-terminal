SCP-3348: TERMINAL 3348-ALPHA READ ME
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
Terminal 3348-Alpha is a secure, web-based interface designed for the study and deployment of SCP-3348 (The Compiled Vocabulary of the Kaejnithionian Language). It serves as a buffer between Foundation researchers and the anomalous reality-bending effects triggered by Kaejnithionian vocalization.

2. CORE FEATURES
Linguistic Aggregator: Processes English concepts into Kaejnithionian Aggregate Strings.

Persistent Database: All custom entries, clearance levels, and passwords are saved to the browser's local storage.

Hume Monitoring: Real-time reality stability tracking via an integrated Kant Counter.

Audit Trail: Secretly logs all researcher search queries for O5/Administrative review.

SRA Protocol: Manual Scranton Reality Anchor activation to reset reality to baseline (1.00 Hm).

. HUME STABILITY GUIDE
Following the research of Doctors Caldmann and Rzewski, the terminal utilizes the following baselines:

Definition: A Hume determines the strength/amount of reality in an area; 1.00 is the baseline.

Kant Counter: The device used to measure these levels via portals to pocket universes.

Hume Level (Hm),Reality Status,RP Effect / Visuals
1.00,Baseline,"Standard reality; the ""sand"" layer is even."
0.40 - 0.70,Unstable,Terminal text begins to flicker; minor reality shifts.
< 0.40,Critical Failure,"Terminal ""Glitch"" mode active; high risk of ontological failure."
0.00,Vacuum,Absolute absence of reality; vacuum baseline.
100.00+,High Hume,Arbitrarily high reality maintained by pocket universe anchors.

4. ADMINISTRATIVE INSTRUCTIONS (STAFF ONLY)
Initial Setup: The default access code is "O5-1". Change this immediately in the System Config.

Redaction: When creating a new word, use the asterisk () in the Kaej String field to create black-box redactions (e.g., Katid becomes Ka███tid).

Data Syncing: To share your word list with other staff, click "Export Database," send the resulting .txt file to other admins, and have them click "Import Database."

Emergency Purge: The "Purge All Data" button deletes all words and resets the clearance level; requires the admin password for confirmation.

5. USAGE TIPS FOR ROLEPLAY
The Panic Button: Use the SRA Activation button during events when a player "over-uses" the language to visually reset the terminal.

The Audit Log: Check the search history to see if researchers are attempting to find "Forbidden Concepts" (e.g., Death, God, Termination).

Variable Clearances: Change the Clearance Stamp to "SITE DIRECTOR EYES ONLY" during high-stakes breaches.
